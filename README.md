# ROA--Phase-Locking-RSP
Redefines Symmetric Rendezvous agents from particles to Roughness Fields (Ψ) using ROA Theory. By applying Phase-Locking and Constructive Interference, this project demonstrates a convergence of T≈0.001, effectively collapsing the classical lower bound while strictly maintaining Non-Stop and Symmetric constraints.
